### Week 8 &mdash; Properties of Continuous Functions &mdash; Start Least Upper Bounds

* Monday, March 17 &mdash; Reading: Study the first eight theorems in Chapter 7 (note that the proofs of the first three theorems are deferred until Chapter 8) &mdash; Problem Set 11: Chapter 7, Problems 1-3
* Thursday, March 20 &mdash; Reading: Finish studying Chapter 7 and read Chapter 8 through the proof of Theorem 1 &mdash; Problem Set 12: Chapter 7, Problems 10-12, and Chapter 8, Problems 1 and 3

### Week 9 &mdash; Finish Least Upper Bounds &mdash; Uniform Continuity &mdash; Start Derivatives

* Monday, March 24 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 8 and study the Appendix to Chapter 8 &mdash; Instead of a new problem set, three presentations: Rania and Will, Problem 1, p. 144; [Brian and Hexi, Problem 2, p. 144](./illustrations/UniformContinuity.nb.pdf); Brendan and Jeremy, Problem 10, p. 139 &mdash; Also, read each others' mid-semester course evaluations and be prepared to discuss &mdash; Surprise: [Continuity Implies Uniform Continuity](./illustrations/ContinuityImpliesUniformContinuity.nb.pdf) (only on a closed interval)
* Thursday, March 27 &mdash; Start Chapter 9, derivatives (which are not on Exam 2!) through to the middle of p. 154 &mdash; Problem Set 13: Chapter 9, Problems 1-6 &mdash; Brian and Brendan: [Newton and Liebniz](./illustrations/NewtonAndLeibniz.nb.pdf)

### Week 10 &mdash; Exam 2 &mdash; Finish Derivatives

* Monday, March 31 &mdash; Exam 2 on Spivak Chapters 5 to 8, including the Appendix to Chapter 8
* Thursday, April 3 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 9, derivatives &mdash; Problem Set 14: TBD

### Week 11 &mdash; Differentiation (Common and Important Rules for Derivatives)

#### Plans for upcoming classes are subject to adjustment, depending especially on the actual pace of the previous classes.

* Monday, April 7 &mdash; Reading: Start Chapter 10
* Thursday, April 10 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 10

### Week 12 &mdash; Significance of the Derivative

* Monday, April 14 &mdash; Reading: Start Chapter 11
* Thursday, April 17 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 11

#### In the interest of getting to The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we may have to skip Chapter 12 on inverse functions, and go straight to Chapter 13 on integrals. I am not sure how much Chapters 13 and 14 depend on Chapter 12.

### Week 13 &mdash; Integrals

* Monday, April 21 &mdash; Reading: Start Chapter 13
* Thursday, April 24 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 13

### Week 14 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus &mdash; Exam 3

* Monday, April 28 &mdash; Reading: Chapter 14
* Thursday, May 1 &mdash; Exam 3
