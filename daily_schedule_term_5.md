### Week 8 &mdash; Properties of Continuous Functions &mdash; Start Least Upper Bounds

* Monday, March 17 &mdash; Reading: Study the first eight theorems in Chapter 7 (note that the proofs of the first three theorems are deferred until Chapter 8) &mdash; Problem Set 11: Chapter 7, Problems 1-3
* Thursday, March 20 &mdash; Reading: Finish studying Chapter 7 and read Chapter 8 through the proof of Theorem 1 &mdash; Problem Set 12: Chapter 7, Problems 10-12, and Chapter 8, Problems 1 and 3

### Week 9 &mdash; Finish Least Upper Bounds &mdash; Uniform Continuity &mdash; Start Derivatives

* Monday, March 24 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 8 and study the Appendix to Chapter 8 &mdash; Instead of a new problem set, three presentations: Rania and Will, Problem 1, p. 144; [Brian and Hexi, Problem 2, p. 144](./illustrations/UniformContinuity.nb.pdf); Brendan and Jeremy, Problem 10, p. 139 &mdash; Also, read each others' mid-semester course evaluations and be prepared to discuss &mdash; Surprise: [Continuity Implies Uniform Continuity](./illustrations/ContinuityImpliesUniformContinuity.nb.pdf) (only on a closed interval)
* Thursday, March 27 &mdash; Start Chapter 9, derivatives (which are not on Exam 2!) through to the middle of p. 154 &mdash; Problem Set 13: Chapter 9, Problems 1-6 &mdash; Brian and Brendan: [Newton and Liebniz](./illustrations/NewtonAndLeibniz.nb.pdf)

### Week 10 &mdash; Exam 2 &mdash; Finish Derivatives

* Monday, March 31 &mdash; [Exam 2](./exams/Exam2.nb.pdf) on Spivak Chapters 5 to 8, including the Appendix to Chapter 8
* Thursday, April 3 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 9, derivatives &mdash; Problem Set 14: Chapter 9: Problems 7-11 &mdash; Two groups presented Problems 12 and 14? &mdash; I presented a better solution to the last part of Exam 2 Problem 7

### Week 11 &mdash; Differentiation (Widely Used Properties of Derivatives) &mdash; Start Applications of Derivatives

* Monday, April 7 &mdash; Reading: Study Chapter 10 to the bottom of p. 173 &mdash; Problem Set 15: Problems 1 to 7, but for Problems 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, just do the first half of the many parts (e.g., if there 18 parts, only do the first 9)
* Thursday, April 10 &mdash; Reading: Finish studying Chapter 10 and continue studying in Chapter 11 to p. 192 &mdash; Chain Rule (Derivation and Application) &mdash; Problem Set 16: Chapter 10, Problem 17, and Chapter 11, Problems 1-3 (for these three, first half of the many parts only) &mdash; Presentations: Rania presented Chapter 10, Problem 22; Hexi and Jeremy presented applications of the Mean Value Theorem

### Week 12 &mdash; Finish the Significance of the Derivative &mdash; Inverse Functions

* Monday, April 14 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 11 (skip the Chapter 11 Appendix) &mdash; Problem Set 17: Chapter 11, Problems 6 to 12 (these are typical applications to real-world problems of the extrema-finding techniques in Chapter 11, albeit somewhat contrived)
* Thursday, April 17 &mdash; Reading: Only one class devoted to Chapter 12 (inverse functions) so that we can have all the remaining time in the semester to introduce integrals &mdash; On p. 234, there are very useful results arising from combining the inverse function idea with the chain rule theorem &mdash; Problem Set 18: Chapter 12, Problems 4 to 7

### Week 13 &mdash; Integrals

* Monday, April 21 &mdash; Reading: Start Chapter 13 through p. 260 &mdash; Problem Set 19: Chapter 13, Problems 1, 2, and 7(i)-7(iv) &mdash; Draw graphs of what you are calculating so that you build intuition &mdash; Use graph paper and draw the graphs to scale &mdash; [No graph paper, click on this?](./illustrations/print-graph-paper.com.pdf) &mdash; You should be able to check (by counting squares on the graph paper) that your analytical results are consistent with the graphs
* Thursday, April 24 &mdash; Reading: Finish Chapter 13

### Week 14 &mdash; The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus &mdash; Exam 3

* Monday, April 28 &mdash; Reading: Chapter 14
* Thursday, May 1 &mdash; Exam 3 on Spivak Chapters 9 to 14
