## Daily Schedule Term 4

### Week 1 &mdash; Chapter 1 &mdash; Properties of the Real Numbers

* Monday, Jan. 13 &mdash; Reading: Chapter 1, pp. 3-10, postulates (P1)-(P12) for the real numbers &mdash; How to read mathematics: (1) when the author &ldquo;leaves something for the reader&rdquo; stop and do it, and (2) keep a constant eye on what has so far been postulated (as an axiom), defined, or proven (in a theorem, a lemma, or a corollary) and be very careful not to use things that seem obvious but have not yet been postulated, defined, or proven &mdash; In-class: we got started on the end-of-chapter problems
* Thursday, Jan. 16 &mdash; First homework: Write up Problems 1-3 (which have many subparts) &mdash; For all of the first three problems, it would be best to work in a two-column format where you do the work in the left column, and enumerate which postulates you used in the right column &mdash; To keep the verbosity under control, let's agree that we don't have to constantly reiterate that a-b means a+(-b), that a/b means a&times;b<sup>-1</sup>, and that -(a&times;b)=(-a)&times;b=a&times;(-b) &mdash; Second Reading: Finish Chapter 1, and read the first three pages (pp. 21-23) of Chapter 2 (on mathematical induction) &mdash; I am particularly interested in attempting Problem 10 of Chapter 2 in class, but you guys might prefer something else
